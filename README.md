# Project Description

The objective of this exercise is to improve a set of existing code to meet accessiblity standards and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability while also maintaining the code's original functionality, i.e., code refactoring.

This can be accomplished by meeting the following criteria:  
> Ensure that...  
>> - semantic HTML elements are found when viewing the source code.
>
>> - the HTML elemental structure follows a logical styling/positioning-indepent structure when viewed.
>
>> - accessible alt attributes are found when viewing the image elements.
>
>> - the heading attributes fall in sequential order.
>
>> - the title element is concise and descriptive.

I was able to achieve these goals through revisions of the HTML (e.g., removing extraneous code, renaming attributes, or changing the designators where necessary, etc.) and the consolidation and reorganization of the CSS selectors and properties to follow the HTML elemental semantic structure. All coding was done using Visual Studio Code. Copies of the original html and css files provided for comparison in the directory listed below.
